Weather app
Here i worked with css media queries and clamps (didn't implement clamp).
Also worked with the open weather api to get the data for each city.
Had responsiveness in mind throughout.
Also worked on error handling, taking account different scenarious.
Trimmed my code where needed to be as light weight as posssible.
